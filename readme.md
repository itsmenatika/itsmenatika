# **itsmenatika** <- yaa, it's me

I'm just aspiring software developer who decided to create her own github account to share how it goes. I don't know who i will become in the future yet though.
I'm currently mostly interested in languages such as:
- Javascript:
   * discord.js
   * typescript
   * Jquery
   * react
   * node.js
- html, css
   * tailwind (to be honest i don't know that much about this one yet)
- python
   * pygame
   * asyncio
   * some numpy and pillow (not much yet)

i also know some of c++, c and java.


# Projects that i've created/taken part of

## [Bitservice](https://github.com/virtual-float/BitService)

That was a project that was designed to fit a competition that I and my colleague were taking part of. Unfortunately we haven't won anything spectacular.
In the game you're supposed to take the role of worker (defacto also a boss) named kera who decided to run a bussiness alone.

## [Biro](https://github.com/itsmenatika/biro)

> [!CAUTION]
> The production stage of the project is still ongoing and isn't even in beta stage.

Multifunctional bot written using typescript and discord.js. Bot supports multiple languages and slash commands.

## [Easy javascript quiz system](https://github.com/itsmenatika/firstQuizSystem)

> [!WARNING]
> The project is probably closed and won't see futher continuation (at least there's no plans yet)

My one of the first projects in javascript. That's just pretty simple javascript quiz system, there's nothing more to add.
